<h2>What is this dish?</h2>
<p>This is an easy-to-make and scalable recipie for a comforting and filling potato soup. It's a great recipie for a cold day, when it's snowing outside and all you want is to relax on the couch. It's also handy for when you need to feed a lot of people quickly, since it's so easy to scale up!

    I've enjoyed this recipie many times. We've made it on cold Colorado snow days, and for having friends over for a party. The flexibility means you can add your own twist to it with hot sauces, sausage, peppers, and more!
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Serves two</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        12 oz. Yukon Gold potatoes
    </li>
    <li>
        1 Tbsp Chicken Stock Concentrate
    </li>
    <li>
        6 oz. Bacon (or italian sausage!)
    </li>
    <li>
        1 medium yellow onion
    </li>
    <li>
        2 green onions
    </li>
    <li>
        2 cloves of garlic
    </li>
    <li>
        2 cups 2% milk
    </li>
    <li>
        1 Tbsp sour cream
    </li>
    <li>
        1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese (Shred your own if you can. The preshredded stuff has some compounds to keep it from sticking together that will impact the texture of our soup!)
    </li>
    <li>
        1 Tbsp flour
    </li>
    <li>
        Kosher salt
    </li>
    <li>
        Black pepper (preferrably from your pepper grinder)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Optional:&nbsp;</strong> Hot sauce of your choice
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Dice potato into 1/2 pieces. Dice the yellow onion. Slice the green onion, separating the whites and greens. Cut bacon into small pieces. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Measure and set aside the flour, milk, and other ingredients.&nbsp;<em>Mise en place.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a medium pot on the stovetop at medium heat, and add the bacon. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is cooked and crispy. Remove the bacon from the pot and place on a paper towel lined plate.&nbsp;<strong>Do not drain the bacon fat. This is flavor for the next step.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the yellow onion to the pot with the bacon grease with a small sprinkle of salt. Cook until soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then add the whites of the green onions and the garlic. Cook, stirring for 30 seconds then add the flour. Cook, stirring until the raw flour smell dissipates and the flour browns slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add splashes of the milk to the roux, stirring the whole time to incorporate. As each splash is fully incorporated add another until all of the milk is incorporated. Add the potatoes, chicken stock concentrate then cover the potatoes with water.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bring mixture to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are tender and easily smashed with a fork. Usually about 15 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove from the heat, and mash the potatoes to your desired consistency. If you want it extra smooth use an immersion blender! Taste and season with salt and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mix in half of the cheese, and half of the bacon. Divide into bowls and top with some sour cream, remaining bacon, cheese, and green onions. Top with a hotsauce if you want to add a kick!
