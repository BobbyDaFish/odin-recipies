<h3>What is this dish?</h3>
<p>This is an easy-to-make and scalable recipie for a comforting and filling potato soup. It's a great recipie for a cold day, when it's snowing outside and all you want is to relax on the couch. It's also handy for when you need to feed a lot of people quickly, since it's so easy to scale up!

    I've enjoyed this recipie many times. We've made it on cold Colorado snow days, and for having friends over for a party. The flexibility means you can add your own twist to it with hot sauces, sausage, peppers, and more!
