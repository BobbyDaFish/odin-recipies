<h2>What is this dish?</h2>
<p>The Old Fashioned is an age-old, tried-and-true cocktail. A simple blend of whiskey, simple syrup, bitters, and orange. Sometimes a cherry. This recipie isn't anything revolutionary, but it is refreshing.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        1.5 oz of whiskey of your choice (I usually prefer bourbon. If you're not sure what kind, Bulleit is usually more than acceptable.)
    </li>
    <li>
        1 tsp of simple syrup
    </li>
    <li>
        1 tsp cold water
    </li>
    <li>
        2 dashes of aromatic bitters
    </li>
    <li>
        Twist of orange peel
    </li>
    <li>
        A couple large ice cubes (or one of those giant cocktail ones, if you have the means)
    </li>
    <li>
        1 cocktail cherry (I actually don't recommend maraschino cherries, they're too sweet)
    </li>
</ul>
